# CNN ELM for Age Estimation - Final Year Project
Most of age detection or classification used backpropagation as a training method. However, the process required iteration to get the minimum error. Here we propose new combination algorithm using Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machine. This method leverage pre-trained Convolutional Layer from ImageNet and VGGFace for the feature extraction process. Unlike common neural networks, we use Extreme Learning Machine for training the extracted features without gradient (iteration) process.

# Key Points
1. Implements Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Machine Learning Algorithms.
2. Solving the problem of training time in building an age classification model.
3. Build an age classification model that can compete with state-of-the-art methods.

# Installation and Usage
This project was built from Kaggle Development Environment System. If you want to try this repository you can clone and run the notebook file in kaggle and also dont forget to add the UTKFace dataset. i put the requirements.txt in this repository and you can use it in Kaggle before run the notebook.
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
