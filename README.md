# Key Points
1. Implements Convolutional Neural Network and Extreme Machine Learning Algorithms.
2. Solving the problem of training time in building an age classification model.
3. Build an age classification model that can compete with state-of-the-art methods.

# Installation and Usage
This project was built from Kaggle Development Environment System. If you want to try this repository you can clone and run the notebook file in kaggle and also dont forget to add the UTKFace dataset. i put the requirements.txt in this repository and you can use it in Kaggle before run the notebook.
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
